## Setting up Kyushuzumo.

You need to make install dependencies from the Pipfile, alter some code 
in settings.py. Some of these changes are covered below.

## Configuring Kyushuzumo (settings.py)

To configure Kyushuzumo to work, you'll also need to setup your environment, because the project expects environment
variables to show a secret key. Since the project is left in DEBUG mode, you may want to set up your own
secret key in the .env file.
Other dependencies are listed in the Pipfile.
